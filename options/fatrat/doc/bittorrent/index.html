<p>
FatRat includes an extensive BitTorrent support. However, its usage may not be as intuitive as with other BitTorrent clients, since FatRat is a universal download manager.

<p>
The first important thing to know is that torrents aren't marked as completed, until the share ratio has been reached. This means that an active BitTorrent transfer has two states: downloading and seeding. You can tell these two from each other by looking at the completion bar or the state icon (blue icon = downloading, red icon = uploading). The default share ratio can be set in the settings dialog. Alternatively, the maximum share ratio can be changed on a per torrent basis - see the transfer properties.

<p>
If you want to seed indefinitely, force resume the transfer. The transfer won't be stopped as "completed" then.
