<p>
The Jabber network is utilized to enable users to control and check FatRat remotely. It allows you to move between queues, list transfers, delete them or even create new ones. The access is password-protected, and additional measures (like limiting access to our own JID) can be activated as well.
</p>

<p>
The main advantages of this function (when compared to remote access via a Java applet) are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can do fine with any Jabber client application, no matter what PC/device you're working on</li>
	<li>No need for a public IP address</li>
</ul>

<p>
You may let FatRat use your existing Jabber account or create a new one. In the former case it is recommended to set a negative priority in FatRat so that your buddies don't accidentally write messages to FatRat. Keep in mind that some mobile Jabber clients (such as Bombus) disregard client priorities and some may still run into having chat with the bot. Hence you should consider allocating a new JID specifically for this application.
