Enter your account's information into <code>Settings - RapidShare.com</code> (not applicable to unregistered users). Whenever you upload a file, the related download (and possibly kill) link can be found in transfer's log. This may not be very comfortable to use, therefore in the settings dialog you can specify a text file where links are to be saved. Note that kill links are generated for anonymous uploads only.

<p>Since the upload is performed by sending chunks of the file, uploads can be resumed. However, the data of the last (incomplete) chunk have to be uploaded again.</p>
