FatRat uses the CMake build system.

An example compilation procedure:

cmake . -DWITH_BITTORRENT=ON -DWITH_SFTP=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make
make install

The prefix can be changed to /usr using -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr. The default prefix is /usr/local,
but may be implementation dependent.

Should you need to make install to a different directory, the traditional DESTDIR is supported.

CMake may have issues finding your JDK installation. Should that happen, try exporting variables such as
JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH2, JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH and JAVA_JVM_LIB_PATH.
